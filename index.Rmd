### Low pitch is ***masculine***  and a ***grandmother***?! {data-commentary-width=800}

<div align="center"> Firstly, I would like to ask you to **listen** to this short music snippet: \
\
<audio controls>
  <source src="h_3.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>  <br> \
How would you *describe* this sound? Does it evoke any word associations? Is it, perhaps, *high*? Would you say that it sounds more *blunt* than *sharp* or vice versa? \
\

**Metaphors** are no strangers to our everyday life. Even without realizing, we use metaphors on a daily basis: *time is money*, *heart made of gold*, *someone being an early bird/night owl*… \
\
For the majority of us, another essential part of the human experience is **hearing**. Hearing is said to be the most *abstract sense* out of the human senses, so naturally, listening to music is quite a *unique experience*. That is why we tend to borrow words and metaphors that originate from other senses to talk about music. \
\
If you are still reading this text, it is safe to assume that you are a proficient speaker of English. Then, you are probably familiar with **high-low** metaphor that is widely used in English, among other European languages, such as *Russian* and *Dutch*, to describe sounds of the opposite pitch. Interestingly, although this verticality metaphor seems to be the *prevalent* one, it is **not universal** across all 6,500+ languages that exist. \
\
For instance, in *Balinese* (spoken in Bali), pitch is **small** or **large**. In *Gbaya* language family, that consists of dozen various languages from the western Central African Republic, pitches are arranged *genealogically*, so high-pitched sounds are called a **granddaughter** and low-pitched - a **grandmother**. Alternative metaphors include **feminine – masculine**, **rough – smooth**, **thin – thick**, among many others. \
\
All of these diverse metaphorical pitch descriptions might sound *foreign* and a *bit baffling*. But what if I told you that you would probably apply these metaphors to high- and low-pitched sounds in the same way as a native speaker? That is, if presented with a low-pitched sound (imagine something like a *heavy bass* sound), you would be more likely to describe it as **masculine**, **smooth** and a **grandmother** than **feminine**, **rough** and a **granddaughter**. \
\
Even if it sounds far-fetched at this point, I invite you to **click through the dashboard** and see how I investigated *whether foreign metaphors are applied correctly to high- or low-pitched sounds by English speakers*!


### *Sounds* and *Metaphors*: Research through a Survey {data-commentary-width=900}

![](qr.png)

***

With this research, I wanted to **check whether the foreign metaphors are applied to high- and low-pitched sounds in the same way as they are in the language of origin**. To test that, English-speaking participants were asked to **listen to a high- or low-pitched instrumental music excerpts** and **judge** whether the word presented on the screen afterwards is *related or unrelated* to the sound. \
\
Please feel free to take a **short demo version of the survey** by *scanning the QR code* on the left or *clicking the [link](https://uva.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0c9QSJTUWGCi4qq)*! \
\
*In theory*, participants are expected not only to *correctly answer* whether the word matches the sound or not, but also answer faster when the word *is* indeed related to the heard sound. This phenomenon, called the semantic priming effect, is seen in language experiments. For example, when one *reads* or *hears* the word *dog*, other **words associated** with *dog*, such as *leash*, *cat*, *food*, come to mind, not *puzzle*, *case* and *gum*. \
\
The same principle can be applied to music: if you hear a *piccolo* (one the highest-pitched instruments) *solo* and then see the word **thin**, you should be able to categorize the word as *related to the sound* without thinking too much about it. Conversely, if you see the word **thick**, it might require more time to process whether the word is *really* related or not. \


### **Results**: **Accurate**, but *not* **Fast**. *What Does it Mean*? {data-commentary-width=900}

As expected, **participants could accurately judge whether the metaphor is related or not to the audio**. For example, high-pitched excerpts were said to be **thin** and **sharp**, but **not thick** and **blunt**, that is in the same way as the sounds would be described in the language of origin. \
\
*Unfortunately*, people did not answer faster when the audio was related to the word. So listening to a low-pitched sound prior to seeing the word *thick* or *blunt* did not make people answer faster than when they saw *thin* or *sharp*. \
\
I found that participants agreed on *what is the right metaphor* and *what is the wrong metaphor* to describe a high/low-pitched sound. Therefore, **we might be born with all of these various pitch descriptions in our minds**, but we just do not use all of them in our native languages. However, when needed, like in the case of completing an experiment, we can use those words as if they are present in our native language.\
\
Also, music might evoke certain word-associations after we listened to it, but they are not as strong as if we were to match word to word. Perhaps, the words *knife* and *sharp* are more related in our mind than a piccolo playing and *"sharp"*. \
\
My study showed how multifaceted human cognition is even when it comes to such seemingly simple and even mundane tasks as musical pitch processing. Taking my finding into consideration, figuring out the *precise* brain mechanisms behind how pitch and our thoughts interact is a puzzle to solve for future researchers!
